# An Anarchist Cyberpunk Tabletop RPG? 
** rough draft

I'm planning on developing a cyberpunk RPG based on Anarchist philosophy and  practice. It will be based on the principles of community building, direct action and resistance and DIY culture. It will try to have low barriers of entry, be accessible and have safety tools to help deal with the potentially difficult subject matter. It will try to educate people about Anarchism directly and through references. Just now its in the notes and research stage (mostly playing similar games to see what they can bring). If anyone want to contribute it would help, I’m busy and inexperienced at game design. 

## Why Cyberpunk?

Many themes are still relevant, while we may be pivoting to a more nationalist style of government we are still very much in neo-liberalism that cyberpunk was supposed to be a critique of. Being sci-fi its distant enough to give some buffer to what could be emotional for some but is close enough to be relevant.

## Community building

Building communities of resistance will be both textually and mechanically supported. People with common struggles getting together to fight oppression will be a large part of the game. Each of the players will belong to different communities which will encourage interaction between communities as well as within them. Whether these are communes, syndicates, unions of egoists, insurrectionary cells, punk/hip-hop scenes etc. will be left up to the GM and players though to a certain extent plurality will be encouraged. No form of oppression and resistance to it will be emphasised, feminism, Queer issues, anti-racism, Anti-colonialism/imperialism, class war, antifa, will all be examined. The document will try to avoid sectarianism between forms of anarchism (or possibly even left-libertarianism generally), to some extent, again,  pluralism will be encouraged though of course no bigots or ‘anarcho’ capitalists, monarchists, fascists or outright primitivists (some anti-civ stuff has a point but outright primitivism means death to those who rely on medication, tech aids etc. to live such as myself so I take issue).  

## Direct Action and Resistance

Direct action will be supported textually and mechanically. What counts as direct action will be looked at. Other forms of action will be looked at, for example media will be used as part of community building but direct action will play a central role. There is a discussion to be had on combat, not that I'm opposed to combat morally but in game terms I find the legacy of D&D means most games are almost all framed almost exclusively  around combat, which is boring, and enables weird macho power fantasy. whatever direction the game system goes in it should be more on the 'realistic' end of things and should have consequences and other forms of direct action should be available.

## DIY Culture

DIY culture will be supported textually, and mechanically will support this through DIY cyberware and hacker/maker culture. Media skills will be included as part of community building. An open license will also encourage people to make their own supplements for the game.

## Low barriers to entry

The game will be designed with new players in mind, you shouldn't have to be an RPG nerd to play this. It will be easy to photocopy or print (Black and White, A4 and letter format, Simple Art, Open license (displayed prominently to avoid arguments with printers etc., not overly long) It will use a 2d6 (or possibly 1d6) system so if left at a community centre or whatever folks can raid the off brand monopoly or whatever inevitably rotting in the games cupboard for dice. Translation will be encouraged.

## Accessibility and Safety

Safety tools will be integrated into the design so that these potentially emotive issues can be dealt with safely and with all members of the group being comfortable. Electronic editions will be designed with captions for screen readers and alternative fonts and sizes in mind. Accessibility in general will be researched.

## Educational

References to political works will be included to help radicalise people. There will be quotes scattered throughout the text and a further reading section. Preferably various sorts of media so as accessible both in terms of medium (text, video, audio) as well intent, for example entertainment media (anarcho-punk etc.) as well as straight theory.
